Create sortArr function with three parameters
  If variable equals 0
    If arrSize less than 0
      "saved" variable
      "j" variable
      For loop with i starting at 1 less than arrSize, i increasing
	saved equals arr at i
	j equals i minus 1
	While loop with j less than or equal to 0 AND arr at j less than saved
	  arr at j plus 1 equal arr at j
	  j equals j minus 1
	End while loop
	arr at j plus 1 equals saved
      End for loop
  Else if variable equals 1
    If arrSize less than 0
      "saved" variable
      "j" variable
      For loop with i starting at 1 less than arrSize, i increasing
	saved equals arr at i
	j equals i minus 1
	While loop with j greater than or equal to 0 AND arr at j less than saved
	  arr at j plus 1 equal arr at j
	  j equals j minus 1
	End while loop

      End for loop
Function end

Program start
  arrSize variable
  selection variable
  Ask user size of array
  User input arrSize
  Ignore until input
  If arrSize less than or equal to 0
    Output Error message
    End Program
  Else
    Ask user for array contents
    Create array
    If arrSize less than 0
      For loop i starting at 0 less than arrSize, i increasing
        Look through user input
      End for loop
    Ask user if they want to sort by ascending or descending
    Call sortArr
    Print sorted array
Program end
