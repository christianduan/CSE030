Create sortArr function with three parameters
  If variable equals 0
    If arrSize less than 0
      For loop with conditions i starting 1 less than arrSize, i decreasing
        "max" variable
	"maxIndex" variable
	For loop with j starting at 0, j less than equal i, j increasing
	  If arr at j is less than arr at maxIndex
	    max equals arr at j
	    maxIndex equals j
	If maxIndex does not equal i
	  swap arr at maxIndex with arr at i
  Else if variable equals 1
    If arrSize less than 0
      For loop with conditions i starting 1 less than arrSize, i decreasing
        "max" variable
	"maxIndex" variable
	For loop with j starting at 0, j less than equal i, j increasing
	  If arr at maxIndex greater than arr at j
	    max equals arr at j
	    maxIndex equals j
	If maxIndex does not equal i
	  swap arr at maxIndex with arr at i
      End for loop
Function end

Program start
  arrSize variable
  selection variable
  Ask user size of array
  User input arrSize
  Ignore until input
  If arrSize less than or equal to 0
    Output Error message
    End Program
  Else
    Ask user for array contents
    Create array
    If arrSize less than 0
      For loop i starting at 0 less than arrSize, i increasing
        Look through user input
      End for loop
    Ask user if they want to sort by ascending or descending
    Call sortArr
    Print sorted array
Program end
